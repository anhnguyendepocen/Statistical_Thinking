Before I look at these, I am going to listen to some of your sequences. Don't tell me if they were made up, or actual outcomes. I will guess. \n\n## Using permutation to examine association\n\nExample from DBCR: \n\n*The participants in this study were 48 male bank supervisors attending a management institute at the University of North Carolina in 1972. They were asked to assume the role of the personnel director of a bank and were given a personnel file to judge whether the person should be promoted to a branch manager position. The files given to the participants were identical, except that half of them indicated the candidate was male and the other half indicated the candidate was female. These files were randomly assigned to the subjects.*\n\n## Your turn\n\nIs this an observational study or an experiment? How does\nthe type of study impact what can be inferred from the results?\n\n##\n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\nbank <- data.frame(gender=c(rep(\"male\", 24), rep(\"female\", 24)), \n                   decision=c(rep(\"promoted\", 21), rep(\"not promoted\", 3), \n                              rep(\"promoted\", 14), rep(\"not promoted\", 10)))\n```\n\n```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}\nbank %>% group_by(gender, decision) %>%\n  tally() %>% \n  spread(decision, n) %>%\n  kable(format.args=list(width=80))\n```\n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\nkable(addmargins(table(bank$gender, bank$decision)))\nkable(prop.table(table(bank$gender, bank$decision), 1))\n```\n\n## How likely is this?\n \n1. Break any association between gender and decision\n2. Re-tabulate\n3. Compute proportion of women promoted\n\n##\n\nOriginal: \n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\nkable(head(bank, 10))\n```\n\n##\n\nPermuted decision:\n\n```{r echo=FALSE}\nset.seed(4664)\nbank.p <- bank %>% mutate(decision=sample(decision))\nkable(head(bank.p, 10))\n```\n\n",
