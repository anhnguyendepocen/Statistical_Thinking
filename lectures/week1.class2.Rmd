## Using permutation to examine association

Example from DBCR: 

*The participants in this study were 48 male bank supervisors attending a management institute at the University of North Carolina in 1972. They were asked to assume the role of the personnel director of a bank and were given a personnel file to judge whether the person should be promoted to a branch manager position. The files given to the participants were identical, except that half of them indicated the candidate was male and the other half indicated the candidate was female. These files were randomly assigned to the subjects.*

## Your turn

Is this an observational study or an experiment? How does
the type of study impact what can be inferred from the results?

##

```{r echo=FALSE}
bank <- data.frame(gender=c(rep("male", 24), rep("female", 24)), 
                   decision=c(rep("promoted", 21), rep("not promoted", 3), 
                              rep("promoted", 14), rep("not promoted", 10)))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
bank %>% group_by(gender, decision) %>%
  tally() %>% 
  spread(decision, n) %>%
  kable(format.args=list(width=80))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(addmargins(table(bank$gender, bank$decision)))
kable(prop.table(table(bank$gender, bank$decision), 1))
```

## How likely is this?
 
1. Break any association between gender and decision
2. Re-tabulate
3. Compute proportion of women promoted

##

Original: 

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(head(bank, 10))
```

##

Permuted decision:

```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(4664)
bank.p <- bank %>% mutate(decision=sample(decision))
kable(head(bank.p, 10))
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
