# What is markdown?

> An **easy-to-read** and **easy-to-write** plain text format.

* Check out the [markdown homepage](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
  for its philosophy
* Examples of basic syntax
    + Emphasis
        - `**bold**` ===> **bold**
        - `*italics*` ===> *italics*
    * Lists

```

* This slides is written in **R** + **Markdown** = **[RMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)**!!

# Write report in RMarkdown

1. Start RStudio
2. Create a new project (`ETC2420`) for this unit
    + File -> New Project -> Existing Directory -> Empty Project
3. Open a new RMarkdown document and save it as `MYLab1.Rmd` 
    * File -> New File -> R Markdown -> OK -> Knit HTML
4. Look through this sample Rmd document
    + Meta information starting and ending with `---`
    + Embed R code like 
        - One line of R code
<pre>```{r cars} 
summary(cars)
```</pre>
        - Multiple lines of R code
<pre>```{r economics} 
library(dplyr) 
data(economics, package = "ggplot2")
glimpse(economics)
```</pre>
    * Write outside the R chunk but in markdown way
5. Knit the file to a pdf/word document

# Have fun with R
## US economic time series from ggplot2 

* `date`: month of data collection
* `pce`: personal consumption expenditures
* `pop`: total population
* `psavert`: personal saving rate
* `uempmed`: median duration of unemployment
* `unemploy`: number of unemployed
* Read its [documentation](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/economics.html) for
  more details

```{r economics}
```
Can you think of two questions you could answer using these variables?

# Have fun with R
## Gapminder data

```{r gapminder}
```

Can you think of two questions you could answer using these variables?

# Have fun with R
## Pedestrian counts in the city of Melbourne

```{r pedestrian}
```

Can you think of two questions you could answer using these variables?

p.s. I came across with this drawing about the city of Melbourne (1854) in the
2016 rare book exhibition.

# Have fun with R
## R packages

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.package("dplyr")
library(dplyr) # load the package
```

* For example, `dplyr` is an R package written by [Hadley Wickham](http://hadley.nz/).
It is a fast, consistent tool for working with data frame.
* I've also developed the [hts](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hts/index.html)
package on analysing and forecasting hierarchical and grouped time series, with Rob Hyndman,
Alan Lee and Shanika Wickramasuriya. (Yes, this is an advertisement.)
* There are more than 8000 packages available on R CRAN now.

# Have fun with R
## R basics

* Example 1: a vector of numerics
```{r basics1, eval = FALSE}
```

* Example 2: a list
```{r basics2, eval = FALSE}
```

* Example 3: compute statistics on a vector with missing values
```{r basics3, eval = FALSE}
```

# Your turn
## Get things done in R and RMarkdown

1. Read in the OECD PISA data
```{r student, eval = FALSE}
```
2. Tabulate the countries (`CNT`)
3. Extract the values for Australia (`AUS`) and Shanghai (`QCN`)
4. Compute the average and standard deviation of the reading scores (`PV1READ`), for each country
5. Write a few sentences explaining what you learn about reading scores in these two countries

## Turn in 

* Your `.Rmd` file
* Your pdf (or word) file that results from knitting the Rmd
* Make sure your group members are listed as authors, one person per group will turn in the report
* **DUE**: Monday after the lab, by noon, loaded into moodle
